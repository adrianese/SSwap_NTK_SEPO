# SimpleSwap (Sepolia Test)

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a basic token swap smart contract and frontend integration. It's designed for educational purposes and testnet deployment using Sepolia.

##  Features
- ERC20 token swap logic
- Liquidity pool simulation
- Frontend interface (MetaMask-compatible)
- Dynamic token initialization via wallet interaction
- Hardhat + Ignition deployment pipeline
- Sepolia testnet integration

##  Tech Stack
- Solidity (`SimpleSwap.sol`)
- Hardhat & Hardhat Ignition
- Ethers.js frontend with vanilla JS
- Sepolia Testnet (Infura RPC)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational and testing purposes. It runs on the Sepolia testnet and should **not be used in production** or with real funds. The contract logic is simplified and may not reflect best practices for production-grade decentralized exchanges.
